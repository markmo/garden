# 4. Deploy and Test

Now that you have your project and cluster set up, you can go ahead and deploy the project:

```sh
garden deploy
```

You should see your services come up. Next we can set up our first test. Similar to how you configured the `services` earlier, open the `frontend/garden.yml` config and add the following:

```yaml
tests:
  - name: unit
    args: [npm, test]
  - name: integ
    args: [npm, run, integ]
    dependencies:
      - frontend
```

This defines two simple test suites. One simply runs the unit tests of the `frontend` service. The other runs a basic integration test that relies on the `frontend` service being up and running.

Let's run them both:

```sh
garden test
```

You should see the services being ensured to run, and both tests run successfully.

With that, we can move on from this simple example and on to [configuring your own project](./5-configure-your-project.md).
