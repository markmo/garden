# 0. Introduction

This section covers the first few steps when getting started with Garden. We'll go through:

1. [Installing the Garden CLI](./1-installation.md)
2. [Initializing a simple example project](./2-initialize-a-project.md)
3. [Connecting to a Kubernetes cluster](./3-connect-to-a-cluster.md)
4. [Deploying and testing the project](./4-deploy-and-test.md)
5. How you can go from there and [configure your own project](./5-configure-your-project.md)

We recommend quickly reading the [How Garden Works](../basics/how-garden-works.md) section before carrying on, if you haven't already, as well as the [Stack Graph (Terminology)](../basics/stack-graph.md) section for an overview of all the concepts used in Garden.

Once you've done that, head on over to the [next section](./1-installation.md)!
