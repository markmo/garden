# 3. Connect to a Cluster

In order to deploy your new project, you (perhaps obviously) need somewhere to deploy it to.

Here we hit a bit of a fork in the road, since you have a choice between setting up a local Kubernetes cluster on your dev machine _or_ to connect to a remote cluster.

We have separate guides for each of these options. Pick the one you prefer, walk through that guide, and then come back here or skip straight to the [next section](./4-deploy-and-test.md).

* [Local Kubernetes](../guides/local-kubernetes.md)
* [Remote Kubernetes](../guides/remote-kubernetes.md)

Once you've set up your cluster and updated your project configuration accordingly, we can move on to [deploying and testing your project](./4-deploy-and-test.md).
