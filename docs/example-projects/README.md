# Example Projects

## [Demo project](./demo-project.md)

Here we see how to "gardenify" a pre-existing project, creating a project config and the individual module configs for every part.

## [Using Garden in CI](./using-garden-in-ci.md)

In this example we demonstrate how to use Garden in a CI pipeline to run tests and deploy to preview and staging environments. Note that you'll need to have a [remote Kubernetes cluster](../guides/remote-kubernetes.md) set up to complete the steps in the guide.

## [TLS project](./tls-project.md)

This is an example project of how to set up TLS using the `mkcert` tool.

## Other example projects

You can also go straight to the [examples](https://github.com/garden-io/garden/tree/v0.11.16/examples) directory in the
Garden repository, to look at a variety of fully defined example projects.
