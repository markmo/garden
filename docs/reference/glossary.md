# Glossary

#### Environment
Represents the current configuration and status of any running services in the [project](#project), which may be
inspected and modified via the Garden CLI's `environment` command.

Several named environment configurations may be defined (e.g. _dev_, _testing_, ...) in the [project's
`garden.yml`](../using-garden/projects.md).

#### Module
The unit of building in Garden. A module is defined by its [`garden.yml` configuration file](./config.md),
located in the module's top-level directory.

Each module has a plugin type, and may define one or more [services](#service).

Essentially, a project is organized into modules at the granularity of its *build* steps. A module's build step may
depend on one or more other modules having already been built, as specified in its `garden.yml`, in which case those modules will be built
first, and their build output made available to the requiring module's build step.

#### Project
The top-level unit of organization in Garden. A project consists of one or more [modules](#module), along with a
project-level [`garden.yml` configuration file](./config.md).

Garden CLI commands are run in the context of a project, and are aware of all its configuration, modules and services.

#### Provider
An implementation of a plugin type (e.g. `local-kubernetes` for the `container` plugin).

Whenever "a module's type" is mentioned in the documentation, what's meant is "which provider will handle this module?" Providers are responsible for implementing a module type's behaviorsâ€”e.g. how to build, deploy or test the module. Providers need to be specified for all the module types used in the project.

For example, both the `local-kubernetes` and `kubernetes` providers (`kubernetes` is the provider for remote Kubernetes) implement the `container` module type, but they handle deployments differently. `local-kubernetes` deploys to a local cluster, where `kubernetes` deploys to a remote cluster.

For a comprehensive list of providers available in Garden, check out the [References](../reference/README.md)

#### Service
The unit of deployment in Garden. Services are defined in their parent [module](#module)'s `garden.yml`, each
exposing [one or more ingress endpoints](../reference/module-types/container.md#servicesingresses).

Services may depend on services defined in other modules, in which case those services will be deployed first, and
their deployment output made available to the requiring service's deploy step.
